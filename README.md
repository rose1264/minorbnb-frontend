# MinorBnb Frontend - ReactJs

## Project Overview
### <a href="https://medium.com/@rose_shumei_huang/minorbnb-an-airbnb-for-minors-5838782a35d0">Check out more details and video demo here</a>

I was an educational consultant for International high school students. These students have long holidays during Thanksgiving and Christmas to travel around. But Airbnb requires guests to reach 18 years old. Meanwhile, schools usually provide the holiday release for parents or guardian to fill in and sign.

MinorBnb allows the students to upload the school release form while making the reservation, and allow the host to download the form to fill in and sign. That’s the main feature of my website.

I was thinking about making this website last year when I first visited Flatiron School’s science fair. And I did it finally!
